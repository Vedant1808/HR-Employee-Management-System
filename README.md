# HR Employee Record Management System(Java)
In this project, I have created module for Designation and Employee in Java
programming language.Created three layers of application development: the data
layer, the business layer, and the presentation layer.In Data Layer , I used both file
and database to store the data.For the database, I used MySQL and JDBC to
connect MySQL to Java. In the business layer, I maintained various data structures
for efficient data access, and in the presentation layer, I have used the Java Swing
API to create a desktop application.

To execute the application : C:\JavaProjects\hr\pl>java -classpath ..\common\dist\hrcommon.jar;..\dbdl\build\libs\dbdl.jar;..\bl\build\libs\bl.jar;build\libs\pl.jar;c:\java\jarFile\itext7\*;c:\java\jarFile\mysqljar\*;. com.thinking.machines.hr.pl.Main
